ETS2Viewer-Plugin
=================

The plugin required for ETS2Viewer

Excuse me for the lack of files, I am a noob, but I will try to get more files here at some point. If you download the Telemetry SDK [here](http://www.eurotrucksimulator2.com/mod_tools.php) however, you can just use one of their examples and replace the .cpp file with this one.

The server-client portion of this project, and the windows easy-to-install .zip can be found [here](https://github.com/Fordcars123/ETS2Viewer).
